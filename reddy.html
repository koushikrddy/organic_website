    <h2 id="reddy">Virat Kohli</h2>
    <p id="jk">Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ ã…™Àà…æ…ëÀê à ÀàkoÀê…¶li] ‚ìò; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
        cricketer who plays Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain
        in all formats, Kohli retired from Twenty20 International (T20I) following India's win at the 2024 T20 World
        Cup. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He represents Royal
        Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as
        the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in
        international cricket.[5] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands
        second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest
        batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli was a key member of the
        Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained
        India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6]

        In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of
        T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the
        number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In
        2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]

        Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is more than any player in International Cricket, making him the most
        decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in
        2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year,
        on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and
        Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World
        for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and
        'Player of the Series' awards to his name, respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level,
        Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour,
        the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential
        people in the world.

    <h2 id="reddy">Early life</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked
        as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an
        older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at
        Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a
        three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[12]

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd
        espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
        to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his
        son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just
        playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in
        the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate
        his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
        eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received training at the academy while
        simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In
        pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade
        education.[14]

        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[14][17] During his
        childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as
        the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at
        times.[11][18] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took
        cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[14]
        Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to
        Gurgaon.[19]</p><br><br>
    <h1>Career</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Player profile</h2>
    <hr><br>
    <h2 id="reddy">Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar:</h2>
    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin
        Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
        "successor",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[22][23]
        His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is
        well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and
        attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades
        from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing
        style.[25] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian
        cricketer.[26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of
        shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who
        has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[28]

        In a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the
        potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting
        aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[29] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from
        international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in
        the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father.
        Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.[30]</p>
    <h2 id="reddy">Playing style</h2>
    <p>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing
        demeanour.[31][32] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly
        open-chested stance,[33] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile
        footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in
        high-pressure situations.[34][35] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather
        than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in
        the mid-wicket and cover region.[36][37]


        Kohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup
        Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He
        possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg
        stump.[12] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an
        emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[38] Kohli
        is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and
        long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination
        of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field
        positioning.[39] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[40]

        However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[41] Bowlers often exploit
        this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[42] This vulnerability
        has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[43][44] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former
        India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[45][46] and former New Zealand cricketer
        Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[47]

        Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing
        experts and aficionados alike.[48][49] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7
        runs when batting first.[50] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[51] and holds the record
        for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[52] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli
        has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate
        his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[53] His colleagues admire his
        self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his
        success.[54][55]</p>
    <h2 id="reddy">Aggression</h2>
    <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He
        is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce
        competitiveness.[56][57] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team
        by example.[58] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his
        career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics
        and former cricketers alike.[59][60] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[61][62] others
        have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes
        resulting in a loss of composure.[63] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has
        acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve.
        Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and
        drives his focus and motivation on the field.[64] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's
        self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an
        inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on
        and off the cricket field.[65]</p>
    <h2>Public image and in media</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his
        notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills and
        attitude and saw great potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was
        signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment.[66] Over the years, Kohli's brand endorsement portfolio has
        experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ‚Çπ1 billion
        (US$12 million).[67] In 2023, his brand value reached ‚Çπ1,000 crore (US$120 million).[68] His bat deal with MRF
        is regarded as one of the most financially rewarding deals in cricket history.[69] In 2017, Kohli entered into a
        notable endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ‚Çπ1.1
        billion (US$13 million). This deal made Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract
        valued at ‚Çπ100 crore (equivalent to ‚Çπ140 crore or US$17 million in 2023) deal with a brand.[70] As of January
        2023, Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at ‚Çπ165 crore
        (equivalent to ‚Çπ175 crore or US$21 million in 2023).[71] Kohli is currently recognized as the most followed
        Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram, boasting over 266 million followers on the platform.
        Reports indicate that he is able to command a fee of ‚Çπ8.9 crore (equivalent to ‚Çπ9.4 crore or US$1.1 million in
        2023) for each sponsored post on the platform.[72]


        Virat Kohli's signed bat at Blades of Glory Cricket Museum, Pune
        Kohli has gained international acclaim for his athletic achievements and widespread popularity, earning a
        prominent place among the world's most renowned athletes, as per ESPN.[73][74] In 2014, American Appraisal
        conducted an evaluation of Kohli's brand value and determined it to be $56.4 million, placing him fourth on the
        list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[75] The following two years saw Kohli's brand value soar higher.
        As per a report published in October 2016 by Duff & Phelps, Kohli's brand worth had increased to $92 million,
        second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[76] In 2017, Kohli was recognized by Forbes as the
        seventh "Most Valuable Brand among Athletes", surpassing renowned sports figures such as Lionel Messi, Rory
        McIlroy, and Stephen Curry, with a brand estimation of $14.5 million.[77] By September of the same year, Kohli
        had amassed endorsement agreements with 17 distinct brands, and he announced that he would only endorse products
        that he personally uses and believes in.[78] The following year, he was featured on Time magazine's annual list
        of the 100 most influential people in the world.[79] In 2019, Kohli was the only cricketer included in Forbes'
        list of "World's 100 Highest-Paid Athletes". He was ranked 100th on the list, with earnings estimated at $25
        million, with $21 million being procured through endorsements, and the remainder from salary and tournament
        winnings.[80] Furthermore, in March 2019, Kohli was named the brand ambassador of the mobile esports platform,
        Mobile Premier League.[81] Kohli's earning potential continued to climb, and in 2020, he attained the 66th spot
        in Forbes compilation of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020, with estimated
        earnings exceeding $26 million.[82] In April 2021, Vivo appointed Kohli as their brand ambassador ahead of the
        Indian Premier League.[83]</p>

    <p>Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the
        moniker of "Virushka".[89] During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered
        Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.[90] Their
        union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling
        around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship.[91] On 11
        December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, Italy, becoming one of
        the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country.[92] On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first
        child, a daughter, who was named Vamika.[93] The child's name, Vamika, is derived from Sanskrit, meaning "little
        goddess".[94] On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy named Akaay.[95]

        In 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the
        symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting his
        finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from
        consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health.[96] He has since clarified that his
        dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products and eggs
        effectively making what is known in India as an eggetarian.[97][98][99][100][101] Kohli is widely recognized for
        his physical fitness and intense training regimen.[102] He has been an advocate of leading a healthy lifestyle,
        which involves regular exercise and a nutritious diet. His hard work and discipline in this area have earned him
        the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.[103]

        Kohli has acknowledged to harbour a belief in superstitions. He has publicly avowed his reliance upon various
        lucky charms and rituals that he feels serve to bring him good fortune on the cricket field. One such tradition
        involves the donning of black wristbands, which he adheres to as a talismanic tradition. Additionally, he is
        known to prefer a particular pair of gloves, which he has consistently worn due to their supposed propensity to
        bring him success.[10] Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn for
        religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012.[104] In addition to the previously mentioned
        superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket
        field.[105] Kohli has tattoos of the revered Hindu deity Lord Shiva, the sacred syllable "Om", the names of his
        parents, Prem and Saroj, a tribal emblem, a representation of a serene monastery, a samurai warrior, the
        astrological symbol of the scorpion, and his ODl and Test match cap numbers.[106][107]</p>
